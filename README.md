# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
get the values of the first and second coordinates. 
### Step 2: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 3: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 4: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
x1,y1=[4,2]
x2,y2=[10,6]

d=((((x2-x1)**2)+((y2-y1)**2)))**0.5 
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))
```
